# Food Order App

<center>

## Same as the <a href="https://github.com/NIxNref/Assessmen-PWD" target="_blank">Website Version</a> the purpose of this website is for you to order some food if you're hungry. I made this project when I had free time so there's not much about it. I made this project only using Dart, and for now not all the functions are working, I will work on that later. Hope you all enjoy it.
